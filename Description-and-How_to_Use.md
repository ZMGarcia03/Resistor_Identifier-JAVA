# Resistor_Identifier-JAVA

This Java program calculates the resistance of a resistor based on its color bands. The user inputs the colors of the first two bands and the multiplier band, and the program outputs the resistance value in ohms.

## Java Implementation (ResistorColorCode.java)

- **File Extension:** `.java`
- **Dependencies:** None

- **Usage:**
  1. **Save the Code:**
     - Save the provided [`Java code`](ResistorColorCode.java) to a file named `ResistorColorCode.java`.

  2. **Compile the Code:**
     - Open a terminal or command prompt.
     - Navigate to the directory where the `ResistorColorCode.java` file is saved.
     - Compile the Java file using the following command:
       ```sh
       javac ResistorColorCode.java
       ```

  3. **Run the Program:**
     - Run the compiled class file using the following command:
       ```sh
       java ResistorColorCode
       ```

  4. **Enter Band Colors:**
     - When prompted, enter the colors of the first two bands and the multiplier band of the resistor.

  5. **View Result:**
     - The program will calculate and display the resistance value in ohms.

## Example:

```sh
Resistor Color Code Calculator
Enter the color of the bands:
First band: red
Second band: violet
Multiplier band: yellow
The resistance value is: 270000.00 ohms
```

In this example, the program calculates that a resistor with a red, violet, and yellow color code has a resistance of 270,000 ohms (270 kilo-ohms).

This Java-based resistor color code calculator is a useful tool for quickly determining the resistance value of resistors based on their color bands.


### How to Use the Java Program
